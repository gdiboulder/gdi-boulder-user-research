					<h2>What is UX?</h2>
					<p>
					User experience design is a set of activities and philosophies that ensure users’ needs are understood, addressed, and – ideally – surpassed.
					<br />
					</p>
					<p>
					UX can encompass many other disciplines, and many other disciplines can encompass UX.
					</p>
					<p>
					- UX101 Paul McAleer
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						UX designers seek to make experiences useful & usable. Experiences can be digital or physical, or a combination of the two. ‘User’ is the keyword in user experience. The designer’s goal is to know as much about the user, their motivations, environment, goals, etc. as they can when designing something for them.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>User experience design without user research is <em>not</em><br/>user experience design.</h2>

					<h2>User interface design is <em>not</em> user experience design.</h2>
					<p>

				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p>...so why do the research and everything else that goes with it?</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<h1>You are not your user!</h1>
						<p>
						- UX101 Paul McAleer
						</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						User experience advocates for the users. Researchers and designers do not assume that they know what is best for the user. The user knows whats best for them, it's the user researcher and designer that learn about it and then advocate for the user with that knowledge.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>So what is user research?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">User research focuses on understanding the behaviors, needs, motivations, and emotions of those who will be using or interacting with your product.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						User research focuses on uncovering what our users motivations, environment, and goals are by talking directly with the people your product is going to serve.

					The goal of market research is to gather information to identify what markets a product could succeed in.
					</p>
					<img src="images/mensPinkShirt.png" class="fragment">	
					<aside class="notes">
						Market research focuses on whether or not a product would do well within a specific market. EX: men’s dept. color pink in the south vs. north

					<h2>What does user research provide?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Removes assumptions made about users</li>
						<li>Gives you and your team data for decision making</li>
						<li>Provides insight into how audiences think about your company or product offering</li>
						<li>Can help identify new business opportunities</li>
						<li>Understand user behaviors and how they make decisions</li>

					<h2>Today's Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create and execute a research study for a company that sells <b>jeans.</b></p>
				</section>
				
				
				
				
				
				<section>
					<h1>Research goals<br/>& objectives</h1>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Identify your stakeholders</h2>
					<p>These are people or teams who would have a vested interest in the research you will be conducting.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Understand what your<br/>stakeholders want to know</h2>
					<p>It's important to know what your stakeholders want to learn and why they feel like research is the way to get answers.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Conduct stakeholder interviews. Have them send you a list of questions they'd like to find answers to.</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<h3>Example:</h3>
						<p>
							<ol>
							 	<li>Why do our customers like doing business with us?</li>
								<li>What is their perception of us and do they know our<br/>total core offerings?</li>
								<li>What could we do better?</li>
								<li>What product and services to our competitors offer that we don’t but you wished we could?</li>
								<li>What percentage of your budget do you spend<br/>with our company?</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						This will help you when it comes to picking battles and politics.
						Stakeholder interviews give you insight into what your stakeholders are looking to better understand and what the goals of the project are.
						> Topics to cover
						> Their position and background
						> Their involvement in the project
						> Their expectations for the project
						> What they hope the outcome of the project will help them or their business achieve
						> Answers to these questions could influence your research with users

					<h2>Establishing research goals & objectives</h2>
					<p>Goals & objectives outline what type information the research activity will be capturing.</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<h3>Example:</h3>
						<p>
							 <ul>
							 	<li>Explore general decision-making process for selecting [industry] services specific to their role.</li>
								<li>Understand decision-making process for choosing our company.</li>
								<li>Explore relationship with the company.</li>
								<li>Explore future business needs</li>
								<li>Assess competitors</li>
								<li>Companies considered/used in the past and why.  Benefits, including products and services offered, and issues with each.</li>
								<li>Explore any current use of competitors and reasons for the use.</li>
							 </ul>

					<h2>How many participants?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Well... it depends.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Interviews should have between 4-12 interviewees, per audience. Spool and Nielsen feel differently about this. Nielsen says about 5 where Spool suggests more. Audience size may determine how many people you interview.

					<h2>If you're recruiting online,</h2>
					<h2 class="fragment">you will need a screener.</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>Creating a screener</h2>
					<p><b>Definition: </b>A screener is a series of questions that help to narrow your participant pool to those you want to talk to during the<br/>actual research study.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Screener format</h2>
					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
					<p>Be clear about the purpose on why you're asking for their time and any incentive you are providing. Provide a clear link<br/>to the screener questions.</p>
					<img src="images/screenerExpectations.png">
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Screener format</h2>
					<h3>2. Screener questions</h3>
					<p>Questions asked should help to weed out any potential participants that do not fit the participant profile that you have determined.</p>
					<p><b>Things to keep in mind</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Questions should map back to the types of participants<br/>you have identified</li>
						<li>No more than 10 questions</li>
						<li><em>Always</em> ask for consent to contact</li>
						<li>Be cautious about asking for personal information</li>
						<li>If a question is closed-ended, make sure the list of options provided is exhaustive</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>3. Screener conclusion</h3>
					<p>Say thank you and state next steps. The screener is not the interview, so you probably should reiterate that the incentive will be paid out if they are selected to interview.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>In-person research</h2>
					<h3>Benefits</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Observe body language and facial expressions</li>
						<li>Easier to build rapport with your participant</li>
						<li>Ability to put a name to a face</li>

					<h2>Interacting with participants</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Build rapport with your participants, you want them to trust you</li>
						<li>Keep their stories are at the center of the interview</li>
						<li>Let your participant lead the conversation</li>
						<li>Master the awkward pause</li>
						<li>Do not correct your participants, ask them to clarify</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Rapport - You’re not going to be friends, but you want the participant to trust you enough to be open with stories and experiences.<br/>
						Stories - Don’t overshare your own stories. Remember, the interview is about your participant and their story. They are the expert<br/>
						Silence - People speak in paragraphs. When interviewing, allow time after the participants speaks to carry on their thought. Not everyone thinks out loud or is quick to talk. Americans don't like awkward silence. Read an article on an American moving to Finland, apparently silence isn’t so awkward there. Quiet lunch when joining colleague at the teachers lunch table resulted in no conversation.

				<section>
					<h2>Notetaking</h2>
					<p>Use whatever method you are most comfortable with.</p>
					<p>Ideally, it will be easy to consolidate notes for when you analyze the interviews.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						It can be in Excel, a note taking app. There's a new tool through Optimal Workshop called Reframer that is specifically for qualitative research.
